About

This repo is a collection of some of my J scripts. I created it primarily because I was curious to know which color Github used for J. Now I do. Light gray, seriously?

What's with the repo name?

I was initially only going to put Conway's Game of Life in J on this, but then I thought, why not other stuff?
