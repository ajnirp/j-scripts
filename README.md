About

This repo is a collection of some of my J scripts. I created it primarily because I was curious to know which color Github used for J. Now I do. Light gray, seriously?

To future me
------------

.deb files provided by J Software for versions 8 and above usually install the normal Unix way (so look for stuff in `/usr/share/j/8.01/...`). To run sentences like `install 'all'` you need to open j console as follows:

    sudo ijconsole
